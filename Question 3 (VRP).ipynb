    "You are a delivery manager for a small company with a single depot and a fleet of three delivery trucks. There are seven customer locations that need to be visited for deliveries. Each customer has a known demand for your product, and each truck has a maximum capacity. Your goal is to find an optimal route for each truck to serve all customers while minimizing the total distance traveled.\n",
